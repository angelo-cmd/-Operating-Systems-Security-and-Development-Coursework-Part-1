High-level description of the security features of an OS file system
The Windows operating system file system includes the following security features:

    Access Control: restricts access to files and folders based on user accounts and permissions.

    Encryption: provides protection for data stored on disk by converting it into unreadable ciphertext.

    User Account Control (UAC): helps prevent unauthorized changes to the system by prompting the user for permission to run programs with elevated privileges.

    Firewall: blocks unwanted network traffic and helps protect against malicious attacks.

    BitLocker: provides full-disk encryption to protect data on lost or stolen devices.

    Defender: an integrated antivirus and antimalware solution that helps protect the system from malware attacks.

    SmartScreen: helps protect against phishing and malware by warning the user when visiting potentially dangerous websites.

These security features help ensure the protection and confidentiality of sensitive data stored on the system, and prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
The Windows operating system uses the NTFS (New Technology File System) as its primary file system. NTFS was introduced in 1993 as a part of the Windows NT 3.1 operating system and has since been the default file system for all versions of Windows.

NTFS provides a number of advanced features compared to its predecessor, the FAT (File Allocation Table) file system, including:

    Increased maximum file and partition size: NTFS can support much larger files and partitions compared to FAT.

    Improved security: NTFS implements file and folder permissions, which can be used to control access to files and directories.

    Better error recovery: NTFS includes an improved mechanism for recovering from disk errors and inconsistencies.

    Improved file indexing: NTFS implements a sophisticated file indexing system, allowing for fast file searches and improved disk management.

    Increased data reliability: NTFS implements a journaling system that helps ensure data integrity and reliability, even in the event of a system crash or power failure.

Overall, NTFS is a robust, reliable and secure file system that is well suited to the demands of modern computing.

COMP7024- Operating Systems Security and Development Coursework- Part 1: Security of an OS- File System Security
1	High-level description of the security features of Windows file system
The windows 11 version 22H2 file system has different security features to ensure the three
security pillars: confidentiality, integrity and availability. The latest version of windows presents
as a primary file system NTFS(New Technology File System). One of the oldest security features
is NTFS permission; it is implemented to set sharing permissions for folders or drives [1]. This
feature differs from the user grant because permission is attached to objects, not files or entire
drives. Another security feature is BitLocker, a full-disk encryption feature that is built into
some versions of Windows, a full-disk encryption tool in the Windows file system that guards
agast unauthorised access to data in the event of theft or loss of the device [2]. Data saved on
the drive is encrypted by BitLocker using encryption techniques, rendering it unintelligible to
anyone lacking the proper decryption key. This maintains the confidentiality of the information
and helps stop sensitive information from getting into the wrong hands [2]. The last feature this
report will discuss is The TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip, is a hardware-based security
feature found in many modern Windows. The purpose of the TPM chip is to securely store
cryptographic keys, and other sensitive data used for authentication purposes [3].
2	Detailed description of how your selected OS supports and provides the listed security features.
In Windows 11 operating system, the NTFS file system determines a security principal’s level
of access and share permission to files and folders. Microsoft released the first version of NTFS
in 2001 [4]. Permissions can be assigned at the user’s discretion by anyone who has ownership
of a file or folder.NTFS permissions allow administrators more granular control over what files
each user account has access. Operating system files and folders are given default permission
hierarchies when Windows is first installed, but a user may need to change these permissions
to comply with specific security requirements [5]. When permission is set on a file or folder, the
windows operating system link a security descriptor to that object. Indeed security settings of
an object, like a file or directory, are defined by a security descriptor, which is a data structure
in the NTFS file system. The security descriptor has four main components: owner, group,
Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) and System Access Control List (SACL) [5].
The second feature is Bitlocker; it employs encryption techniques such as AES-256 or XTS-
AES128 to safeguard data stored on hard drives or USB devices by encrypting it at rest, making
it inaccessible without authentication credentials such as a PIN or password. It also enables
users to build safe backups using external media like DVDs or flash drives, which may then be
utilised if hardware fails. Users must be logged in as an administrator and have a TPM chip
installed on their computer in order to enable BitLocker on a Windows 11 machine. BitLocker
can still be enabled even if the device has no TPM chip by creating a password for the encryption
key or utilising a USB disc as a startup key[6]. BitLocker has been improved with support for
multiple authentication methods, including biometric verification as well as hardware keys like
USB drives or smart cards. The last feature is the TPM chip, which uses hardware-based encryption and works by
encrypting data stored on the hard drive and additionally providing authentication for various
operations and processes. This ensures that only authorized users can access or modify files in
the system, preventing malicious actors from gaining unauthorized access [7]. Furthermore, the
TPM chip helps maintain secure boot processes by verifying digital signatures before allowing
any software code into memory during start-up procedures [7]. TPM offers an additional layer
of security and combined with different tools as Bitlocker, create a really secure environment
against various attacks. Furthermore, this combination that any information you store remains
protected from external threats and internal ones too, they are able to make sure that only you
can view them whenever necessary.
3	Comparison of the listed features in Windows 11 with MacOs
3.1 BitLocker and FileVault
BitLocker and FileVault are both full-disk encryption systems for securing data on a computer’s
hard drive. Nonetheless, they are utilised on different operating systems and have some vari-
ances in features and capabilities. FileVault uses XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key
to help prevent unauthorized access to your startup disk’s information but does not require a
TPM chip for hardware-based encryption.[8] During the encryption procedure, FileVault needs
to generate a recovery key, and it allows extra authentication methods like a password, a user
account, or an iCloud account. One notable distinction between BitLocker and FileVault is
that BitLocker supports hardware-based encryption through a TPM chip, but FileVault does
not and instead relies on software-based encryption. Hardware-based encryption is often rated
more secure than software-based encryption. Generally, also encryption issue has an influence
on the breadth of tools’ weaknesses, and whole-disc encryption allowing and simplest solution
[9]
3.2 NTFS and APFS permission
Ntfs and Apfs permissions are two different technologies used correspondingly in Windows and
mac OS file systems. APFS permissions are used on macOS operating systems, including the
last version, called mac OS Ventura. These type of permissions are based on access control lists
(ACLs) or the traditional POSIX file system object permission, which can be used to specify
access permissions for users and groups.[10] One of the main differences between NTFS permis-
sions and APFS permissions is how they handle inheritance, this is the process of permissions
propagating from a parent folder to its child folders and files. Using NTFS permission, they are
inherited by default but can be disabled or modified depending on the use case. With APFS
permissions, inheritance is not automatic and must be set up manually. NTFS permissions
allow you to set permissions for files and folders in a way that takes into account different types
of access (like read-only or modify). APFS permissions are more straightforward, dealing with
only group permissions. In fact, APFS used the classic POSIX combined with ACL policies.
APFS has three access levels for files: Read, Write, and Execute instead, NTFS has six access
levels: Read, Read and Execute, List Folder Contents, Write, Modify, and Full.

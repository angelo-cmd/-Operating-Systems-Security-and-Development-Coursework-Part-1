COMP7024- Operating Systems Security and Development Coursework- Part 1: Security of an OS- File System Security
1	High-level description of the security features of Windows file system
The windows 11 file system has different security features to ensure the three security pillars
such as confidentiality, integrity and availability. The latest version of windows presents as a
primary file system NTFS(New Technology File System). One of the oldest security features
is NTFS permission; it is implemented to set sharing permissions for folders or drives [1].
This feature differs from the user grant because permission is attached to objects, not files or
entire drives. NTFS permission provides more granular control and is possible only on drives
using NTFS technology. Another security feature is BitLocker, a full-disk encryption tool in the
Windows file system that guards against unauthorised access to data in the event of theft or loss
of the device. Data saved on the drive is encrypted by BitLocker using encryption techniques,
rendering it unintelligible to anyone lacking the proper decryption key. This maintains the
confidentiality of the information and helps stop sensitive information from getting into the
wrong hands [2].
The last feature this report will discuss is PDE ( personal data
encryption ); it is introduced in the latest version of Windows 11 and provides an additional
layer of encryption. In this case, the encryption is not performed on the entire drive or volumes
but on the diskâ€™s single files [3].

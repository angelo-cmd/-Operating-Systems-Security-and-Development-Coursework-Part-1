COMP7024- Operating Systems Security and Development Coursework- Part 1: Security of an OS- File System Security
1	High-level description of the security features of Windows file system
The windows 11 file system has different security features to ensure the three security pillars
such as confidentiality, integrity and availability. The latest version of windows presents as a
primary file system NTFS(New Technology File System). One of the oldest security features
is NTFS permission; it is implemented to set sharing permissions for folders or drives [1].
This feature differs from the user grant because permission is attached to objects, not files or
entire drives. NTFS permission provides more granular control and is possible only on drives
using NTFS technology. Another security feature is BitLocker, a full-disk encryption tool in the
Windows file system that guards against unauthorised access to data in the event of theft or loss
of the device. Data saved on the drive is encrypted by BitLocker using encryption techniques,
rendering it unintelligible to anyone lacking the proper decryption key. This maintains the
confidentiality of the information and helps stop sensitive information from getting into the
wrong hands [2].
The last feature this report will discuss is PDE ( personal data
encryption ); it is introduced in the latest version of Windows 11 and provides an additional
layer of encryption. In this case, the encryption is not performed on the entire drive or volumes
but on the disk’s single files [3].
2	Detailed description of how your selected OS supports and provides the listed security features.
In Windows 11 operating system, the NTFS file system determines a security principal’s level
of access and share permission to files and folders. Microsoft released the first version of NTFS
in 2001 [4]. Permissions can be assigned at the user’s discretion by anyone who has ownership
of a file or folder, Modify permissions, or Full Control permissions. Operating system files
and folders are given default permission hierarchies when Windows is first installed, but a user
may need to change these permissions to comply with specific security requirements [5]. When
permission is set on a file or folder, the windows operating system link a security descriptor to
that object. Indeed security settings of an object, like a file or directory, are defined by a security
descriptor, which is a data structure in the NTFS file system. The security descriptor has four
main components: owner, group, Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) and System Access
Control List (SACL) [5].
BitLocker protects your data, system files, and the Windows operating system by encrypting
the whole hard drive. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and a Trusted Platform Module
(TPM) chip, a piece of hardware that adds an additional degree of protection, are both used.
Other authentication techniques supported by BitLocker include a PIN, a USB drive, and a
network key.[riscrivere]
Users must be logged in as an administrator and have a TPM chip installed on their computer
in order to enable BitLocker on a Windows 11 machine. BitLocker can still be enabled even if
the device lacks a TPM chip by creating a password for the encryption key or utilising a USB
disc as a startup key[6].

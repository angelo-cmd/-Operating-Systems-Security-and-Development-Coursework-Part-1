1 High-level description of the security features of Win-
dows file system
The windows 11 version 22H2 file system has different security features to ensure the three
security pillars: confidentiality, integrity and availability. The latest version of windows presents
as a primary file system NTFS(New Technology File System). One of the oldest security features
is NTFS permission; it is implemented to set sharing permissions for folders or drives [1]. This
feature differs from the user grant because permission is attached to objects, not files or entire
drives. Another security feature is BitLocker, a full-disk encryption feature built into some
Windows versions, a full-disk encryption tool in the Windows file system that guards agast
unauthorised access to data in the event of theft or loss of the device [2]. Data saved on
the drive is encrypted by BitLocker using encryption techniques, rendering it unintelligible
to anyone lacking the proper decryption key. Bitlocker maintains the confidentiality of the
information and helps stop sensitive information from getting into the wrong hands [2]. The
last feature this report will discuss is The TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip, a hardware-
based security feature in many modern Windows OS. The purpose of the TPM chip is to
securely store cryptographic keys and other sensitive data used for authentication purposes [3].
2 Detailed description of how your selected OS supports
and provides the listed security features.
Windows 11 operating system, the NTFS file system determines a security principal’s level of
access and share permission to files and folders. Microsoft released the first version of NTFS in
2001 [4]. Permissions can be assigned by anyone who owns a file or folder at the user’s discretion.
NTFS permissions allow administrators more granular control over what files each user account
can access. Operating system files and folders are given default permission hierarchies when
Windows is first installed, but a user may need to change these permissions to comply with
specific security requirements [5]. When the user sets the permission on a file or folder, the
windows operating system links a security descriptor to that object. Indeed security settings
of an object, like a file or directory, are defined by a security descriptor, a data structure
in the NTFS file system. The security descriptor has four main components: owner, group,
Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) and System Access Control List (SACL) [5].
The second feature is Bitlocker; it employs encryption techniques such as AES-256 or XTS
AES 128 to safeguard data stored on hard drives or USB devices by encrypting it , making
it inaccessible without authentication credentials such as a PIN or password. It also enables
users to build safe backups using external media like DVDs or flash drives, which may be
utilised if hardware fails. Users must be logged in as administrators and have a TPM chip
installed on their computer to enable BitLocker on a Windows 11 machine. BitLocker can
still be enabled even if the device has no TPM chip by creating a password for the encryption
key or utilising a USB disc as a startup key [6]. BitLocker has been improved with support
for multiple authentication methods, including biometric verification and hardware keys like
USB drives or smart cards. The last feature is the TPM chip, which uses hardware-based
encryption and works by encrypting data stored on the hard drive and additionally providing
authentication for various operations and processes. TPM ensures that only authorised users
can access or modify files in the system, preventing malicious actors from gaining unauthorised
access [7].Furthermore, the TPM chip helps maintain secure boot processes by verifying digital
signatures before allowing any software code into memory during startup procedures [7]. TPM
offers an additional layer of security and, combined with different tools such as Bitlocker, creates
a secure environment against various attacks. Furthermore, this combination ensures that any
stored information remains protected from external and internal threats. They can make sure
that only those who own the access key can view them whenever necessary.
3 Comparison of the listed features in Windows 11 with
macOS
3.1 BitLocker and FileVault
BitLocker and FileVault are full-disk encryption systems for securing data on a computer’s hard
drive. Nonetheless, they are utilised on different operating systems and have some variances in
features and capabilities. FileVault uses XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key to help
prevent unauthorised access to the startup disk’s information but does not require a TPM chip
[8]. During the encryption procedure, FileVault generates a recovery key, allowing different
authentication methods like a password, a user account, or an iCloud account. One notable
distinction between BitLocker and FileVault is that BitLocker supports hardware-based en-
cryption through a TPM chip, but FileVault does not and relies on software-based encryption.
Hardware-based encryption is often rated more secure than software-based encryption. Gener-
ally, encryption issue also influences the breadth of tools’ weaknesses, and whole-disc encryption
allows the simplest solution [9]. Another distinction is that BitLocker can encrypt individual
disc partitions as well as provide email and file transfer encryption.
3.2 NTFS and APFS permission
Ntfs and Apfs permissions are two different technologies used correspondingly in Windows and
mac OS file systems. APFS permissions are used on macOS operating systems, including the
last version, mac OS Ventura. These permissions are based on access control lists (ACLs)
or the traditional POSIX file system object permission, which can be used to specify access
permissions for users and groups [10]. One of the main differences between NTFS and APFS
permissions is how they handle inheritance, this is the process of permissions propagating from
a parent folder to its child folders and files. NTFS permissions are inherited by default but can
be disabled or modified depending on the use case. With APFS permissions, inheritance is not
automatic and must be set up manually. NTFS permissions allow the user to set permissions
for files and folders in a way that considers different types of access (like read-only or modify).
APFS permissions are more straightforward, dealing with only group permissions. In fact,
APFS used the classic POSIX combined with ACL policies. APFS has three access levels for
files: Read, Write and Execute. Instead, NTFS has six access levels: Read, Read and Execute,
List Folder Contents, Write, Modify, and Full Control.
3.3 TPM and Apple T2 Security Chip
These two types of chips are similar, but they have different features. TPM is a chip created
for general purposes; various Operating systems, not only windows, can use it, but Apple T2
is designed and optimised only for the macOS platform. Another difference is that TPM is
soldered into the motherboard, but apple T2 Security Chip is a separate chip integrated into
the logic board of Apple’s Mac devices [7] [11].
4 The effects that the listed security features have on ap-
plication developers
These three security features undoubtedly influenced the developer’s behaviour. While design-
ing and creating new features, developers may use these three techniques to guarantee that
critical code or secret information stays safe even if someone obtains physical access to the
system or its network connections. On the other hand, implementing these features requires a
high level of knowledge and privilege in the system to not corrupt the system’s normal func-
tioning. Windows documentation is unambiguous and can provide a massive help in order to
understand these tools. Additionally, the developers have to pay attention to not create any
conflict between privileges, and they do not have to alter encryption systems with the new
extension developed.

5 Conclusion
Microsoft improves overall security by combining TPM, NTFS permission, and BitLocker into
its operating systems. It ensures that users retain total control over their digital assets regardless
of location. Finally, combining a TPM with the file system of Windows 11 provides higher
levels of protection against malicious attacks while also providing convenience through better
program performance due to its capacity to encrypt and decrypt data faster than old techniques.
NTFS permission ensures that users retain total control over their digital information. Finally,
Bitlocker is very reliable and straightforward to use for average users. In conclusion, Windows is
constantly improving the security and reliability of its product, and windows has always proved
to be one of the best products on the market. On the other hand, creating its own security
chip can improve the system’s security and add features like Deniable encryption, which could
give the user different settings to protect their own data.
